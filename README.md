This is a working fullstack MERN app that is currently deployed on Render.com.

To use it, user can first sign up using a valid email account. After signing up, user can list down their workout session. Each user will have their own list and no one else will have access to it. You can delete and edit the workout session as many as you like.

Enjoy your workout without having to worry about tracking it!
